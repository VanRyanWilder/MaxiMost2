## Detailed Data Flow Process

### 1. Authentication Flow

1. **User Initiates Connection**
   - User navigates to "Connected Services" in MaxiMost app
   - User selects "Connect Samsung Health"
   - MaxiMost app generates a state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks
   - MaxiMost stores this state in secure storage

2. **Authorization Request**
   - MaxiMost app sends OAuth request to MaxiMost server
   - Server prepares authentication URL with the following parameters:
     - `client_id`: MaxiMost's registered Samsung Health client ID
     - `redirect_uri`: https://api.maximost.com/auth/samsung-health/callback
     - `response_type`: code
     - `scope`: Requested data permissions (activity, sleep, heart_rate, etc.)
     - `state`: The generated state parameter

3. **Samsung Health Authorization**
   - Samsung Health displays permission screen to user
   - Shows requested data types and access level
   - User reviews and approves or denies access

4. **Authorization Grant**
   - Upon user approval, Samsung Health redirects to MaxiMost callback URL
   - Request includes `code` and `state` parameters
   - MaxiMost validates the state parameter matches the one stored

5. **Token Exchange**
   - MaxiMost server exchanges authorization code for access token
   - Server sends request to Samsung Health token endpoint with:
     - `grant_type`: authorization_code
     - `code`: The authorization code
     - `client_id`: MaxiMost's client ID
     - `client_secret`: MaxiMost's client secret
     - `redirect_uri`: The same redirect URI used in step 2

6. **Token Storage**
   - MaxiMost server receives access and refresh tokens
   - Tokens are encrypted and stored in secure database
   - Associated with user's account ID
   - Refresh token is used to maintain access without re-authentication

### 2. Data Retrieval Flow

1. **Scheduled Data Sync**
   - MaxiMost server runs scheduled sync jobs (every 4 hours)
   - For each connected user account, retrieves stored access token
   - Validates token expiration and refreshes if necessary

2. **Data Requests**
   - Server makes authenticated requests to Samsung Health API endpoints
   - Uses access token in Authorization header
   - Requests specific data types with appropriate parameters:
     - Time range (e.g., since last sync)
     - Data granularity (daily summaries or detailed time series)

3. **Data Types Requested**
   - Steps count: Daily totals and hourly breakdowns
   - Sleep data: Duration, efficiency, stages (deep, light, REM)
   - Heart rate: Resting rate, workout rates, continuous measurement
   - Exercise sessions: Type, duration, intensity, calories
   - Weight measurements: When recorded by user
   - Nutrition data: If available and permitted by user

4. **Data Processing**
   - Server receives data in Samsung Health format
   - Transforms data into MaxiMost's unified health data model
   - Performs validation and sanitization
   - Calculates derived metrics:
     - Activity streak calculations
     - Sleep quality scores
     - Activity intensity minutes

5. **Data Storage**
   - Processed data stored in MaxiMost's database
   - Associated with user's account
   - Historical trends maintained
   - Original source (Samsung Health) tagged with data

### 3. Data Utilization Flow

1. **Habit Tracking Integration**
   - System checks user's active habits against Samsung Health data
   - Automatically marks relevant habits as complete based on data
   - Examples:
     - "10,000 steps" habit marked complete when step count reaches threshold
     - "8 hours sleep" habit marked when sleep data indicates sufficient duration

2. **User Dashboard Updates**
   - Health data visualized in MaxiMost dashboard
   - Progress toward habit goals shown
   - Historical trends displayed
   - Correlations between habits and health metrics highlighted

3. **Personalized Insights**
   - AI analysis of pattern between habits and health metrics
   - Generation of personalized recommendations
   - Adaptive goal setting based on historical performance

4. **Privacy Protection**
   - Data access limited to user's own account
   - Data transmitted using TLS encryption
   - Sensitive health data stored with additional encryption
   - User can revoke access at any time

## Security and Privacy Measures

### Data Protection

1. **Transmission Security**
   - All API requests use HTTPS/TLS 1.2+
   - Data in transit is encrypted
   - API requests use token authentication

2. **Storage Security**
   - Tokens stored using industry-standard encryption
   - Health data encrypted at rest
   - Database access restricted and monitored

3. **Access Control**
   - Least privilege principle applied to all systems
   - Access to user health data restricted to user's own account
   - Admin access to health data prohibited by design

### User Privacy Controls

1. **Consent Management**
   - Clear explanation of data usage before connection
   - Granular permissions for specific data types
   - User can disconnect at any time
   - Option to delete previously synced data

2. **Transparency Features**
   - Data source clearly labeled in UI
   - Last sync time displayed
   - Data usage explained in privacy policy
   - Data retention periods clearly communicated

## Technical Requirements

1. **Samsung Health SDK Version**: Latest stable version
2. **API Protocol**: REST over HTTPS
3. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0
4. **Data Format**: JSON
5. **Request Frequency**: Maximum 4 times per day per user
6. **Maximum Users**: Scaling to 100,000 users

## Compliance
