Please refer to the Maximost Vision & Strategy Brief (ID: maximost_vision_brief) and the AI Validation Framework Summary & Next Steps (ID: maximost_validation_summary_next_steps).

We are now ready to execute Step 4: Zero-Cost MVP Design (Fake Door Test). I need your help to create the assets for a simple HTML landing page that I will build on Replit.

Specifically, please provide:

Detailed Landing Page Content:

Based on the UVP and target audiences in the maximost_vision_brief, and the "Landing Page Copy Generation" examples in Step 4 of the maximost_ai_validation_apply document (which is now summarized in maximost_validation_summary_next_steps), please generate the full text content for the landing page. This should include:
A compelling main headline.
An engaging sub-headline.
3-4 key problem/solution bullet points highlighting how Maximost addresses user pains.
A section briefly listing 3-5 core feature highlights (e.g., "AI Stoic Coach," "Atomic Habit Integration," "Addiction Recovery Module").
A clear Call to Action (CTA) text (e.g., for an email signup button).
The tone should be inspiring, trustworthy, and clearly communicate the unique blend of Stoicism, AI, and performance.
Guidance for Visuals on the Landing Page:

While I'll be coding in HTML on Replit, describe what kind of simple visuals or image placeholders I should use to represent the app mockups mentioned in Step 4 of the validation framework. For example, should I use placeholder boxes with text descriptions, or can you suggest simple icons or abstract imagery that conveys the concepts (AI, Stoicism, habits, performance)?
Email Collection Setup Advice for Replit:

What's the simplest way to collect email addresses from an HTML page hosted on Replit for this "Fake Door" test? (e.g., link to a Google Form, suggest a simple email mailto: link, or a basic third-party form embed if feasible on Replit).
Ad Copy for Driving Traffic:

Please provide 2-3 short ad copy examples (for platforms like Facebook/Instagram or Google Ads) designed to drive traffic to this Replit landing page, targeting the demographics identified in Step 2 of the validation.
Key Metrics to Track for this Test:

Reiterate the specific metrics I need to track from the ad campaigns and the landing page to evaluate the success of this "Fake Door" test (as outlined in Step 4 of the validation summary).
My goal is to quickly set up this test on Replit to gauge initial user interest based on the Maximost promise. Thank you!"
